sfJSLibManagerPlugin
==========================

A simple plugin to manage the inclusion of a javascript library's relevant js &
css files via a single call to a static method

    sfJSLibManager::addLib('my_js_lib');


Installation
------------

To install the plugin for a symfony project, the usual process is to use the
symfony command line:

    php symfony plugin:install sfJSLibManagerPlugin

If the installation of either package fails then you can manually download the
tgz file from

    http://plugins.symfony-project.org/get/sfJSLibManagerPlugin/sfJSLibManagerPlugin-1.0.0.tgz

and then ask symfony to install the downloaded file

    php symfony plugin:install sfJSLibManagerPlugin-1.0.0.tgz

Enable the plugin if necessary by editing config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php:

    $this->enablePlugins('sfJSLibManagerPlugin');


Usage
-----

The plugin looks for a library's config which should be defined in settings.yml.
This specifies the location of the js & css files for a particular javascript
library and should look something like the following:

all:
  .settings:
    js_lib_jquery_ui:
      dependencies: jquery    # optional list of dependencies
      web_dir:    /           # where to find the js & css directories
      js_files:   jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js  # single file or array of files
      css_files:  jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css     # single file or array of files

The addLib() method will return true on success and false on failure (because no
settings were foudn for the requested library for example)

Settings
--------

The settings should appear under a section labelled as the name of the library
prefixed by js_lib_, and then name of the library is all that get's passed to
the addLib() method. Eg:

    sfJSLibManager::addLib('jquery_ui');

dependencies - if dependencies are listed here then the plugin will attempt to
load them before it loads the requested library. Failure to find config for a
dependency will result in the library not being loaded, and the addLib() method
will return false

web_dir - tells the manager where to find the asset dirs (js & css) and it's
relative to /web

js_files - optional setting which lists one or more javascript files to include

css_files - optional setting which lists one or more css files to include
